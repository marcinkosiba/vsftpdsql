#summary Todo list

= Todo list =

This is a fuzzy-ordered list:

 * review mysql code
 * review postgresql code
 * move all of the code to the autogeneration module
 * modify makefile so the user can choose which plugins are compiled
 * add plugin thread respawning
 * extend plugin architecture to use loadable modules
 * add multiple plugin support (so that you can verify the user against a database an a temporary blacklist without modyfying any code)
 * autodetect system features
 * add other db support (SQLite, Oracle..)
 * extend plugin architecture with scripting language support
