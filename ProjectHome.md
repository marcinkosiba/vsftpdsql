This is a fork of the vsftpd ftp server. It moves authorisation and event logging into a database. This means user logins, passwords, directory and file permissions and all events reside in a database as table entries. This allows easier management of big amounts of data (logs) and moves the users away from the operating system. Currently MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported. It's an experimental approach to managing ftp servers and started out as an academic project.
